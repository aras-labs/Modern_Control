        "The expm function, short for \"matrix exponential,\" is a mathematical function used to compute the exponential of a square matrix.\n",
        "The matrix exponential is defined using a power series expansion, similar to the exponential function for scalars:\n",
        "\n",
        "expm(A) = I + A + (A^2)/2! + (A^3)/3! + ...\n",

        "\n",
        "The expm function calculates the matrix exponential by evaluating this power series expansion up to a certain level of accuracy. It is a useful tool for solving systems of linear differential equations, computing matrix logarithms, and solving matrix equations.\n",

        "In Python, the expm function is available in the scipy.linalg module, which is a part of the SciPy library. It can be used to compute the matrix exponential of a square matrix."
